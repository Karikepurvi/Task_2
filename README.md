**Data Visualization**
Hi! This is my submission for Task 2 of the Data Analyst Internship. In this task, I explored a dataset named `train.csv`, which contains information about customer orders â€” including their region, category, segment, order dates, and locations.
Using **Tableau Public**, I created a visual dashboard that helps uncover patterns in customer behavior, order distribution, and trends over time.

**Here are the charts and insights I created in my dashboard:**
1)Orders by Region-A bar chart showing regional distribution of orders.
2)Orders by category-A bar chart comparing the number of orders across product categories.
3)Orders over time(monthly)-A line chart showing how orders vary month to month.
4)Customer segment distribution-A pie chart showing what percentage of orders came from each customer segment.
5)Geographic Order Distribution-A line chart showing how orders vary month to month.

**Tools Used**
- **Tableau Public** for visualization and dashboard design
- **Microsoft Snipping Tool + Word** to export the dashboard as a PDF
- **Dataset**: `train.csv`
- 
This task helped me improve my data storytelling skills using Tableau. I learned how to create charts that not only look good but also communicate clear insights that can drive business decisions.

**Thank you for reviewing my submission!**
